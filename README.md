# Image-editing-software---C
I developed the core functionality of a photo editor using C. The project allowed for advanced image manipulation, including applying filters, resizing, cropping, generating histograms, and an "equalize" function to enhance image contrast. These operations could be applied to both grayscale and colored images. Users could also select specific portions of an image to apply these operations, adding flexibility to the tool. All image handling was done programmatically, with no GUI elements involved, ensuring efficient and flexible image processing.
