# Image-editing-software---C
I developed the core functionality of a photo editor using C. The project allowed for advanced image manipulation, including applying filters, resizing, cropping, generating histograms, and an "equalize" function to enhance image contrast. These operations could be applied to both grayscale and colored images.
